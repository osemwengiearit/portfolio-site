          <li>
            Most government loans such as the Federal Grant and Loans initiative
            are available to businesses with a registered business name. By
            registering your business name with the CAC, you stand a better
            chance of accessing such loans, grants, and sometimes investments.
          </li>
          <li>
            SCUML registration can also benefit your business in the long run.
            By demonstrating compliance with anti-money laundering regulations,
            your business can gain credibility and trust from customers,
            partners, and other stakeholders. This can lead to increased
            business opportunities and partnerships.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having a tax clearance confirms that an individual or a business has
            no outstanding tax liabilities for a specified period, usually the
            last three years. The certificate is a legal confirmation of tax
            compliance, and it's often required when dealing with public
            institutions or formal financial engagements.
